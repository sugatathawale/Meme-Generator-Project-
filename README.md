# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

////Completed Features
1} Meme Selection:
Fetches memes from the Imgflip API and stores them in the state (allMemes).

2}Random Meme Generation:
Provides a "Get random meme" button that, when clicked, selects a random meme from the fetched memes and updates the form with its details (URL, ID, box count).

Based on the selected meme template, the appropriate number of text input fields are displayed (up to 5).
dynamically text box are availabe for that meme

4}Text Placement on Meme:
Sends a request to the Imgflip API to place the user's input text on the selected meme template using the setMemeText function.

5}Input Validation:
Disables the "Put text on meme" button if no text is provided in the input fields, ensuring that at least one text box is filled before the API request is made.

6}Meme Image Display:
Displays the selected or generated meme in an image container, updating dynamically as the user selects or generates new memes.
